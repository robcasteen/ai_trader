Real Production Data
Successfully logging decisions in data/strategy_signals.jsonl:

10+ test records verified
All aggregation methods working
Individual strategy details captured
Metadata properly stored

What's Next
Immediate: Phase 2 - API Endpoints (2-3 hours)
Add REST API to query signal data:

GET /api/strategy/current - Latest signals per symbol
GET /api/strategy/history - Historical signal timeline
GET /api/strategy/performance - Strategy metrics
GET /api/strategy/correlation - Agreement analysis

Future: Phase 3 - Frontend Dashboard

Real-time strategy signals display
Performance comparison charts
Parameter tuning interface
Strategy attribution visualization

Future: Phase 4 - P&L Attribution

Link signals to actual trades
Calculate profit/loss per strategy
Identify best-performing strategies

Key Metrics
