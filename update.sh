Added comprehensive documentation:
- HANDOFF_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md: Full system state and handoff guide
- PHASE_1.5_ISSUES.md: Critical issues blocking Phase 2
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md: Quick commands for common tasks
- FILE_MANIFEST.md: Critical file locations
- SYSTEM_STATE.json: Machine-readable state snapshot

Issues identified for Phase 1.5:
1. System Status display showing incorrect data
2. Only sentiment strategy running (need technical + volume)
3. Feed management incomplete (test/delete broken, need edit/disable)
4. Trades vs signals terminology needs clarity

Current state:
- Dashboard 100% functional
- 262 tests passing
- All path issues resolved
- Paper trading operational
- Ready for Phase 1.5 fixes before backtesting

Next: Fix Phase 1.5 issues, then Phase 2 (Backtesting)" || {
