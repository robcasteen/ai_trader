## ‚ö†Ô∏è PHASE 1.5 REQUIRED

**STOP! Do not proceed to Phase 2 yet.**

Before backtesting, we must resolve critical issues identified after initial deployment:

1. **System Status broken** - Shows incorrect run times
2. **Only 1 of 3 strategies running** - Need technical + volume + sentiment
3. **Feed management incomplete** - Test/delete broken, need edit/disable
4. **Data clarity needed** - Confusion between trades vs signals vs actions

**See:** `PHASE_1.5_ISSUES.md` for detailed breakdown and resolution steps.

**Timeline:** 2-4 hours to fix all issues  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks backtesting and production use

**Then proceed to Phase 2: Backtesting Engine**
